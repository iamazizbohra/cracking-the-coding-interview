### Arrays and Strings


#### 1.1 Is Unique

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

#### (ASCII vs Unicode)
[How Unicode Works](https://deliciousbrains.com/how-unicode-works)

#### Solutions
If we can't use additional data structures, we can do the following:
1. Compare every character of the string to every other character of the string. This will take 0(n2) time and 0(1) space.
2. If we are allowed to modify the input string, we could sort the string in O(n log(n)) time and then linearly check the string for neighboring characters that are identical. Careful, though: many sorting algorithms take up extra space.

These solutions are not as optimal in some respects, but might be better depending on the constraints of the problem.

#### Optimal Solutions
